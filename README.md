# Chocolates: Sales Analysis

## Objective
To analyze chocolate sales data to uncover insights into salesperson performance. In this project, we aim to: 
- Examine pricing consistency across products to see if all customers are charged the same rates.

- Assess the diversity of each salesperson's product mix and its potential impact on revenue.

- Evaluate and compare individual performance, considering both volume and pricing strategy.
