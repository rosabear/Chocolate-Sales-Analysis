# Chocolates: Sales Analysis

## Objective
To analyze chocolate sales data to uncover insights into salesperson performance. In this project, I aim to: 
- Examine pricing consistency across products to see if all customers are charged the same rates.

- Assess the diversity of each salesperson's product mix and its potential impact on revenue.

- Evaluate and compare individual performance, considering both volume and pricing strategy.

## Tools and Technologies used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Scipy
- Plotly

## Dataset
This dataset I used contains records of 8 months worth of chocolate sales, detailing revenue, sales quantity, sales region and type of products, stored in CSV format.

Columns:
1. Sales Person: The name of the sales person in charge of the sale
2. Country: The name of the country where the sale was processed.
3. Product: The name of the product 
4. Date: The date of the sale
5. Amount: The revenue made from this sale
6. Boxes Shipped: The quantity of boxes sold in this sale

## Cleaning the dataset
- Renamed Amount to Revenue, reformatted it and changed type to integer
- Converted Date to datetime format

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Key Insights
- Product prices are not fixed, as revenue per box varies for the same product. This could be influenced by tariffs, inflation, discounts, and price customisation by the sales person.

- All salespersons sell over 70% of the products, suggesting that salespeople have flexible product assignments

- The top 3 salesperson sells 20 out of 22 of the products.

This scatterplot shows a positive correlation between the number of boxes a salesperson sells and their product range. This suggests that those selling a broader variety of products also sell more boxes overall. 

## Conclusion
This analysis reveals strong positive relationships between product range, number of boxes sold, and total revenueâ€”suggesting that versatility in product sales contributes to better performance. While pricing inconsistencies hint at possible regional or strategic variations, the overall data shows that broader product engagement may be a key driver of sales success.
